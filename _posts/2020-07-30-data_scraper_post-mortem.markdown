### The Mission
With little to no Python experience and a lot of gusto I sought to create a data scraper to scrape data to be included in my first project as a data science student.

### The Journey
My experience from the ciriculum led me to BeatifulSoup to scrape the webpages, but after seeking further details about various scraping concepts I happened upon lxml.

### The Outcome
The scraper was able to pull a decent dataset, but unfortunately due to time constraints and my brittle, inexperienced code the data lacked key features that I sought to analyze.

### The Lessons Learned
Brittle code is a killer, especially when scraping from highly variable websites. Error handling is a pain, and exception handling is an even bigger pain. Most important of all though I cemented a lot of my Python basics, and that has allowed me to drive forward in the greater project as a whole.
